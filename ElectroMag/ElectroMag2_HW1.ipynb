    "1. First he passed the beam through uniform crossed electric and magnetic fields E and B (mutually perpendicular, both of them perpendicular to the beam), and adjusted the electric field until he got zero deflection. What, then, was the speed of the particles (in terms of E and B)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Thomson apparently didn’t record the field magnitudes he used but we can make reasonable assumptions based upon the technology of the time. Assume the magnitude of the electric field is $$2 * {10}^{4}\\frac{V}{m}$$ and the magnitude of the magnetic field is $$2 * {10}^{-3} T$$ Using these values what was the speed of the particles from the first part?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then he turned off the electric field, and measured the radius of curvature, R, of the beam, as deflected by the magnetic field alone. In terms of E, B, and R, what is the charge-to-mass ratio (q/m) of the particles? Given the geometry the radius, R, was likely in the range 1-5 cm. Using those values and the values for the zero-deflection velocity and magnitude of the magnetic field, calculate the charge-to-mass ratio for the electron. Compare the value to a calculation using the modern accepted values of charge and mass of the electron.\n",

    "4.  In this part you will numerically simulate the electron trajectory through the fields and compare against \n",
    "your analytic results above. Use the modern accepted values of charge and mass for the electron.\n",
    "Geometry and initial conditions: Assume the electron enters the field region at t = 0 with position $$r(0) = x(0)\\hat{x} + y(0)\\hat{y} + z(0)\\hat{z} = 0\\hat{x} + 0\\hat{y} + 0\\hat{z}$$ and initial velocity $$v(0) = 0\\hat{x} + 0\\hat{y} + 0\\hat{z}$$ (i.e., the beam initially travels along $+\\hat{y}$). Choose constant fields $$E = E\\hat{x}+0\\hat{y}+0\\hat{z} , B = 0\\hat{x} + 0\\hat{y} + B\\hat{z}, $$\n",
